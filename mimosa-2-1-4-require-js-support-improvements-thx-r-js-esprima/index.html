                <p>Mimosa <code>v2.1.4</code> brings with it something I've procrastinaed on for awhile thinking it would be much harder than it was. <code>v2.1.4</code> includes mimosa-require <code>v2.0.0</code> which vastly improves how that module determines your JavaScript code's <code>define</code> and <code>require</code> dependencies/config. </p>

<p>How does it improve it?</p>

<h3 id="backstory">Backstory</h3>

<p>The functionality that is mimosa-require's require.js support was one of a few key reasons I built Mimosa in the first place (starting almost 2 years ago!).  Brunch didn't support AMD/require. Grunt was young, hard to configure (still is) and...just no. And there really wasn't anything else.</p>

<p>I wanted something that would:</p>

<ul>
<li>validate dependency paths</li>
<li>validate requirejs.config.paths</li>
<li>map paths, shim and shim dependency paths, etc</li>
<li>let me know a path is bad the second it is bad</li>
</ul>

<p>This validation alone is a huge time saver.  And it really comes in handy when reorganizing your codebase.  Move folderX to folderY then work your way through all the pathing errors mimosa-require informs you of and you are set.</p>

<p>I also wanted something that could determine the "main" require.js files, build out a r.js config, run it and output the results. Ideally it would do this without a single line of config, just by being smart about how require.js works and by programmitically learning things about the code as it was processed.</p>

<p>But the way mimosa-require was determining your dependencies and requirejs config was, well, it was <strong>evil</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="thehack">The Hack</h3>

<p>mimosa-require used <code>eval</code>.</p>

<p>And I feel shame.</p>

<p>Rather than try and tackle any sort of complicated parsing or regex, I decided, maybe correctly at the time, that a better, quicker way to get the information mimosa-require needed was to <code>eval</code> your JavaScript code.</p>

<p>mimosa-require defined in-scope versions of <code>define</code>, <code>require</code> and <code>requirejs</code>, then <code>eval</code>ed your JavaScript.  The local version of, for instance, <code>define</code> would capture the dependency array and off it would go.  It would even treat the callback function as a string and search for embedded <code>require</code> calls in the event you were using require.js' <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html">commonjs wrapper</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that <code>eval</code> was there never caused problems in and of itself, but treating the code that way would.</p>

<p>Everything would work great if you all your code was wrapped in <code>define</code> and <code>require</code>, and it would work great if any code outside those function calls didn't attempt to access some scope that mimosa-require's server-side <code>eval</code> wouldn't know anything about.</p>

<p>But, if your code looked like this?  Trouble.</p>

<pre><code>var uA = window.navigator.userAgent;  
define(["a","b"], function(a, b) {  
  ...
});
</code></pre>

<p>mimosa-require would define a <code>window</code>, just to cover a lot of global variable cases, but <code>window.navigator</code> would not exist in-scope. So <code>window.navigator.userAgent</code> would throw an error and mimosa-require would be unable to do anything with this file.</p>

<p>Bummer.</p>

<p>It would be an even bigger bummer if this file was one of your "main" files.  mimosa-require would now not know it was a main file and it would not build the combined file.</p>

<h3 id="useesprima">Use Esprima</h3>

<p>I've had "require + esprima" on my ToDo list for a very long time, but I knew it would be a huge effort.  So much to parse, so many edge cases.  Ugh.</p>

<p>Then <a href="https://github.com/dbashford/mimosa-require/issues/29">an issue</a> was logged against mimosa-require that had this problem at its root and I finally decided to look into it.</p>

<p>While I love writing <a href="http://esprima.org/">esprima</a> AST parsing code -- for reals, its legit awesome to write -- I was not going to love writing this.</p>

<h3 id="rjstotherescue">r.js to the Rescue</h3>

<p>I remember shortly after I released Mimosa and mimosa-require that <a href="http://jrburke.com/">James Burke</a> the creator of require.js switched how require.js itself parses code to use Esprima. Certainly the tool mimosa-require is trying to help you use -- and that has to do all the things that mimosa-require does, just not interactively -- can provide some guidance.</p>

<p>An API for this maybe?  No such luck.  And why would there be.</p>

<p>But there is a <a href="https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/jslib/parse.js">parse.js</a> sitting in the r.js repo.  And it does have a <a href="https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/jslib/parse.js#L118"><code>parse</code></a> function.  And it does have a <a href="https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/jslib/parse.js#L356"><code>findConfig</code></a> function.</p>

<p>Well, that's awesome.</p>

<p>It's not exposed, and it doesn't <em>quite</em> do what I need it to, but some copy paste, some minor hacking and day after I started I had ripped out the <code>eval</code> BS and replaced it with r.js' legit esprima parsing.</p>

<h3 id="ugh">Ugh</h3>

<p>Seriously.  That's all it took.  Copy, paste, 75 lines of code changed/removed.  I let the <strong>evil</strong> fester for an exceptionally long time because I knew it would be 1000+ lines of code to do it properly and I had a lot of other higher priorities.  For whatever reason it didn't occur to me that those 1000+ lines of code already existed.</p>

<h3 id="win">Win</h3>

<p>So now there are far fewer caveats to the require.js support.  mimosa-require won't run your code and it won't trip over anything.  It's using the same parsing mechanism r.js uses, so all should be right.</p>

<p>So <a href="http://mimosa.io/started.html">try it out</a>.</p>
